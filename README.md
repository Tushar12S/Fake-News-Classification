# Fake-News-Classification
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to classify news articles as either real or fake. With the increasing prevalence of misinformation in the digital age, this system aims to provide an automated and efficient solution to detect fraudulent news content. By leveraging pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) and employing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, the model captures the semantic and sequential dependencies of textual data to make accurate predictions.

The workflow begins with loading and preprocessing the dataset, which includes cleaning text by removing stopwords, special characters, and unnecessary whitespace. The textual content is then tokenized and converted into padded sequences to ensure uniform input for the LSTM model. Pre-trained GloVe embeddings are integrated to represent words in a dense vector format, capturing meaningful semantic relationships.

The architecture of the model includes an embedding layer initialized with GloVe vectors, followed by LSTM layers to process sequential data. Regularization techniques such as dropout are applied to prevent overfitting, while dense layers are used for binary classification, employing a sigmoid activation function to predict the probability of a news article being fake.

To evaluate the model, training and validation accuracy and loss are monitored and visualized across multiple epochs. Additionally, word cloud visualizations are generated to identify frequent terms in the dataset, with separate visualizations for real and fake news articles, providing insightful trends in textual content.

This project utilizes popular Python libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Matplotlib, and WordCloud, along with the pre-trained GloVe embeddings. The dataset consists of news articles labeled as real or fake, with textual features being the primary input for classification. Unnecessary columns are dropped, and rows with missing values are removed to ensure clean and reliable input data.

The Fake News Detection System has practical applications in various domains, including content moderation on social media platforms, automated fact-checking tools, and mitigating the spread of misinformation. Future enhancements could include integrating more diverse datasets, exploring advanced architectures like Transformer models, and deploying the system as an API or web application for real-time detection.
